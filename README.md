# GetGoogleImages
Download google images (.br) on a given topic (limits to 100).
This code is an adaptation of something I found sometime ago and I can't find the source, if you are the original author, contact me and credits will be given where they are due.
I only tested it in python 3, though python 2 integration has been thought of and should work.
Just type whatever you want to download and it will get the corresponding images while saving them to a folder on your working directory named after your search query.
I do not take any responsability over what you download nor over the repercurssions of a possible malware, etc. Use at your own risk.
